# Memristor-Network-Reservoir
This repository is a modified fork (only spoken digits) of the work https://github.com/GTANAKA-LAB/Memristor-Network-Reservoir ([Tanaka and Nakane, Sci. Rep., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13687-z)). It is a simulation platform for pattern recognition based on reservoir computing with memristor networks.
